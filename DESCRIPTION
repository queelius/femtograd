Description: Provides automatic differentiation via reverse-mode AD (backpropagation)
    for first-order gradients and forward-over-reverse AD for Hessian computation.
    Includes log-likelihood functions for exponential family distributions
    (normal, exponential, Poisson, binomial, gamma, beta, negative binomial,
    Weibull, Pareto), MLE optimization via fit() with base R generics (coef, vcov,
    confint, logLik, AIC/BIC), hypothesis testing (likelihood ratio, Wald),
    profile likelihood, bootstrap inference, and model diagnostics.
    Designed for pedagogy and modern statistics rather than large-scale ML.
