\title{Log1p with underflow protection}
\usage{
log1p_safe(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A value object or numeric}
}
\value{
log(1 + x), accurate even for x near zero
}
\description{
Computes log(1 + x) with protection for very small x.
}
\details{
R's built-in log1p is already stable, but this version adds
autodiff support and handles the case where 1 + x might underflow
to 1 for very small x.
